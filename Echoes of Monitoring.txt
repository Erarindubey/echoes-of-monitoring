### 🔍 **Project Title:** Echoes of Monitoring  
*A self-healing orchestration layer with DAG observability and real-time alerting.*

### 🧱 Core Stack  
- **Apache Airflow** for orchestration  
- **Apache Spark** for processing  
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection  
- **Grafana** for visualization  
- Optional: **Slack / Email** for alerting, and **Python scripting** for recovery logic


### 🛠️ Key Features  
- **Real-Time DAG Monitoring:** Track task duration, failure rate, retries, queue latency  
- **Self-Healing Logic:** Use task status to trigger dynamic retries or alternate paths  
- **Prometheus Exporter:** Custom metrics like “active DAGs,” “failed DAGs,” “recovery events”  
- **Grafana Dashboards:** Visualize trends, task latency, and health indicators  
- **Proactive Alerting:** Send notifications on threshold breaches (e.g. retry count > 3)  
- **Recovery Decorators:** Python decorators around tasks to log and auto-fix common errors


### 📈 Stretch Goals  
- Create an **incident timeline view** using DAG metadata  
- Use **container sidecars** for lightweight Prometheus exporters  
- Add **Kafka** to stream task logs for deeper diagnostic views
