ðŸš€ Performance & Reliability
- Self-Healing Workflows: Automatically detects failures and triggers recovery without manual intervention.
- Zero Copy Errors: Ensures clean, validated transfersâ€”no orphaned or corrupted files.
- Resource Awareness: Tracks CPU and memory metrics to prevent overload and fine-tune execution.

ðŸ“ˆ Observability & Insight
- Real-Time Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana reveal live system health and task progression.
- Metric-Rich DAGs: Every step is observableâ€”giving fine-grained visibility into orchestration lifecycles.
- GC Tracking: Detects potential memory leaks early via object lifecycle visualization.

ðŸŽ¯ Scalability & Optimization
- Modular Design: Easily pluggable into new workflows and pipelines.
- Prometheus Labeling: Scales monitoring across DAGs with templated metrics.
- Performance Tuning: Metrics help identify bottlenecks and optimize resource usage.

ðŸ’¡ Developer Experience
- Fewer Debug Cycles: Clear insights mean faster resolution of issues.
- Structured Logging + Metrics: Together they offer a dual layer of traceabilityâ€”like having X-ray vision on DAGs.
- Documentation Ready: With intuitive metric endpoints and dashboard visuals, onboarding becomes frictionless.

ðŸ”” Alerting & Automation Potential
- Custom Alerts: Trigger real-time warnings for failures, threshold breaches, or task timeouts.
- Future-ready Hooks: Designed to evolve into predictive systems using time-series analytics or auto-scaling triggers.
